# Instagram for iPad

This project contains a framework for using Instagram's API, and a iPad app for
viewing your instagram feed. It's written in swift.

It was written as a personal project to spend some time trying out feature of swift 3
and iOS 10 outside of my job. Also because I love instagram and really wanted to it 
on iPad, and I wanted to build an app with lots of great media for iPad.

**Note** - This project has no affiliation with Instagram.
